    "Today, we are going to be analyzing a dataset, from a research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood. This dataset contains information about players in a particular MineCraft Server, from the player's age to total number of hours played. Using this dataset, we are aiming to answer the following question: \n",

    "Can age and total played hours predict if the player is subscribed to a game-related news article?\n",

    "•  *Subscription Status* (logical): Indicates whether the player is subscribed to the newsletter (TRUE/FALSE).  \n",
    "•  *Hashed Email* (string): Unique identifier for each player.  \n",
    "•  *Total Hours Played* (double): The total number of hours the player has spent in-game.  \n",

    "In this project, we explored if data concerning a Minecraft server player's age and number of played hours is able to predict if they would be subscribed to the game-related newsletter. In our exploration, we found the age range of players to be from 8 to 50, with a mean of 20.5. Additionally, we discovered that the average number of hours played was 5.9, but there was a large range, with the maximum number of hours being 223.1. In our initial exploration, there appeared to be no direct correlation between the amount of hours played on the server along with the player's age to their subscription habits to a game-related newsletter. However, there was some correlation between age and subscription habits (younger players were more likely to subscribe). Initial graphs also suggested that players who subscribed had a higher number of hours played. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering these initial trends, we used K-Nearest Neighbour classifcation to investigate this relationship further. Our cross-validation results suggest that the best K value to use was k=9, which provided a 65% classifcation accuracy (which is suffcient for a training set). We then evaluated the training set performance with the test set. The final test accuracy was 57.69%, as mentioned above. This suggests that there is a slight correlation between the number of hours played and the age of the player concerning whether they are subscribed to a game-related newsletter, but there isn't a strong relationship between the two predictors and what we were predicting. This does answer our question, because it demonstrates that there is some correlation between age, played hours and suscription habits, there in our model there was not significant correlation idetified. \n",
    "\n",
    "These results were somewhat expected because, based on our initial exploration showed a slight correlation between the individual predictors and if they were subscribed. The overall predictive accuracy was quite low, considering our earlier visualizations, as they indicated that the two variables are not reliable predictions. In the future, as age and hours played were not reliable predictors, we could explore additional features that identify a player's interest in the magazine in order to eventually make a model that could successfully predict magazine subscribers, making it easier to identify the magazine's target audience and create marketing strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some limitations to our model. The size of the data set is a limitation because when it is split there is a limited number of points. This causes the model to ber less accurate as the K-value is working off a limited number of values. This could be improved by having a larger data set from the minecraft server. This would our model because more data would lead to a more accurate prediction as the k value has more values to work off of, through this process a clear trend may establish itself. "
